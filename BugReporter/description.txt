Allows a user to file a bug report with the following information:

- First name
- Email
- Problem that occurs
- Expected behavior
- Steps to reproduce
- Interruption state description (ex: UI, functionality (buttons not working, etc))

Report data gets sent to any developer email address with the data being passed in JSON formatting.
Users will also get a client-side copy of this JSON data that is loaded with the application to tell the user which reports they've made in the past.
