- user can input commands rather than using full uri's. - 50% done
- api headers/usage information is loaded first and displayed to the user - cancelled, not necessary.
- continuous usage (program runs until exit) - done

- implement the /search/users endpoint.
- add models for some objects (users, repositories)

need to move all of this information to somewhere else :p
